                <p>
                    I always love to collect minimal and mordern <br>
                    furniture for my home and specially for my <br>
                    work place. Due to covid situation as I need <br>
                    to work from home so now a days its <br>
                    mandatory for me to think more creatively <br>
                    within my work place. so, minimal colored <br>
                    furniture will help me a lot in this case.

                <h4>Needs</h4>
                <p>

                    Current app UI is messy. I think need to <br>
                    improve the app user interface, So that all <br>
                    information can be found organized and easy <br>
                    to navigate. Also need to show the order <br>
                    process in a mordern way.

                </p>
                <h4>Pain Points</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>cant find the size of the product directly <br>
                        from the app user interface </li>
                    <li> I cant track my order properly </li>
                    <li>There is no option to make a report for <br> the product issue </li>
                    <li> I cant find the return option from the app <br> user interface</li>
                    <li>Current app interface is really hard to <br> navigate and browser as all information <br>

                Problems will come up. Your willpower will run out. Like <br>
                mana or stamina, willpower is a finite resource. When your <br>
                own willpower runs out, you re in trouble. Your iron will <br>
                begin to crack. You ve without a doubt felt this before. <br>
                Maybe youve noticed its easier to avoid bad habits in the <br>
                morning. By the time you finish school , or work , or <br>
                whatever else you have going on during the day, junk food <br>
                is a lot harder to resist.
